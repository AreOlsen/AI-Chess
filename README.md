# Ai-chess.

As the title suggests, this is a project about mathematical based artificial intelligence for chess. No neural networks ;), purely math based. You play as white against an AI with a custom set hardness level.
I believe there are some bugs, or something along those lines at the moment, as the AI plays... not very great, it is easily beatable and often blunders.
