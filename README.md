# AI-chess.

As the title suggests, this is a project about mathematical based artificial intelligence for chess. No neural networks ;), purely math based. Even though technically neural networks, is also math based, well this is simply another approach requiring a lot less time to get running. It uses the minimax function combined with Alpha-Beta pruning to let the AI make the best mathematically move possible. You play as white against an AI with a custom set hardness level.
I believe there are some bugs, or something along those lines at the moment, as the AI plays... not very great, it is easily beatable and often blunders.

TODO:
* Fix bugs in the AI which makes it play not very great.
* Implement custom FEN string starting positions. 
* Implement approximated chess-elo for each Ai difficulty level.
* Optimize using transposition tables.
* Implement such that one can play both sides, not just white.
* Rework design and look of website, to make it look well better!
* Make a Youtube video going through how this was made, and the mathematics. (A tutorial of sorts. )
